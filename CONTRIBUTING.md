Contributing to Apex Trigger
We are thrilled you're interested in contributing to the Apex Trigger project! Your contributions—whether code, documentation, or bug reports—are vital to making this game the best it can be.

By participating, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct.

1. Getting Started
1.1 Prerequisites
Before submitting any code, please ensure you have:

Read the project's CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

Familiarized yourself with the project structure and technology stack (e.g., Unity/Unreal, C#/C++).

Signed the Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA), if required for major contributions.

1.2 Reporting Bugs
Do not open a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities; please report them directly to the Core Team at [YOUR CONTACT EMAIL HERE].

For all other bugs, please search the existing Issues to see if it has already been reported.

If new, open a clear bug report with:

A concise, descriptive title.

Steps to reproduce the bug.

The expected result and the actual result.

Screenshots or log files, if applicable.

1.3 Suggesting Features
We welcome new ideas!

Before spending time coding a major feature, please open an Issue to discuss the proposed change with the maintainers. This prevents wasted effort on features that may not align with the project's direction.

2. Code Contribution Workflow (Pull Requests)
All code contributions follow the standard Fork & Pull Request workflow.

Fork the Repository: Navigate to the main Apex Trigger repository on GitHub and click the Fork button.

Clone Your Fork: Clone your personal copy to your local machine:

Bash

git clone [Your Fork URL]
Create a New Branch: Never work directly on your main branch. Create a new descriptive branch for your changes:

Bash

git checkout -b feature/add-new-weapon
# OR
git checkout -b fix/level-load-error
Commit Changes: Make your changes, stage the files, and commit with a clear message.

Commit Message Style: Use the imperative voice (e.g., "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug") and keep the subject line concise (under 50 characters).

git add .

git commit -m "Feat: Implement plasma rifle logic and assets"

Push to Your Fork: Push your new branch to your personal remote repository:

Bash

git push origin <branch-name>
Open a Pull Request (PR): Navigate to the original Apex Trigger repository on GitHub. You should see a prompt to open a PR from your branch.

3. Review and Style Standards
3.1 Code Style
Ensure your code adheres to the existing naming conventions and style. Inconsistency will delay merging.

Remove any debug code, console logs, or commented-out sections before submitting.

3.2 Pull Request Checklist
To ensure a smooth review process, please check the following before submitting your PR:

[ ] The PR title is descriptive and concise.

[ ] I have linked any relevant Issues in the description.

[ ] My code follows the established project coding style.

[ ] All existing tests pass, and new features include new tests where applicable.

4. Code of Conduct and License
By contributing, you are affirming that all your work is your own and that you agree to license your contributions under the project's Apache License 2.0.
